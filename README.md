Student Registration Page - Java Project

This project is a Student Registration Page developed in Java. It allows students to register their details through a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The project demonstrates the fundamental principles of Java programming, such as object-oriented design, GUI development, and database integration.

Student Registration Form:

Collects information such as name, age, email, phone number, and address.

Validates user inputs (e.g., email format, required fields).

Data Storage:

Stores registered student information in a database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) or a local file (if database integration is not implemented).
